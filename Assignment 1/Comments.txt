As we can see 

For image 10.jpg which has the quantization effect with a difference of 10, the number of shades n the image is less therefore we can see the transition of shades in the backgroun is less smooth than it used to be

For image 20.jpg which has the quantization effect with a difference of 20, the number of shades is less than the previous (10.png). The details visible in this image has dropped significantly when compared to the previous image

For image 30.jpg which has the quantization effect with a difference of 30, the number of shades decreased furthermore. alot of details in the hair colors were loss and overall the picture looks irritating to the eye

All in all, the 10.png image is the best version as it would take less space on the hard disk when compared to the original image.
