As we can see, applying applying histogram equalization helped in showing details in pictures 1,3 and 5. This helped 
make the segmented clearer while maintaining the origial image. 

On the other hand, in images 2 and 4 applying histogram equalization added some details to the image. For example in Image 2
the darker side of the sky and sea were darkened a bit more. In Image 4 some details were also added but these details actually 
made the image worse.

All in all, in images 1,3 and 5 applying histogram equalization improved the image. But in Images 2 and 4 the added details 
worsened the output image.
